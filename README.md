SPT [or Single-Player-Tarkov] uses a custom AKI [meaning it uses custom outside Unity Plug-ins and allows for player's to play EFT with progression [quests, traders and otherwise]; it is for all goods purposes Escape from Tarkov with PVP removed.
There are loads of mods ranging from custom AI and Custom Trader and Custom Quest frameworks which are listed on the SPT hub.

So what is "Project WIP" [my temporary code name for the complete gameplay overhaul], and how does it differ from regular EFT or even SPT?

### CORE EFT[SPT] GAME MECHANICS WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE
### Trader

menu's
standing's/Levelling up
specific gear [like Ragman]
specific currency's only
This will be replaced with a new Trader system ENTIRELY
Instead of going from main menu>trader's>make purchases, Instead it will work the following way:
Utilizing the New Profile Configurator, you will administrate for whatever Private Military Company of your choosing. As for the first Alpha testing there will only be BEAR and USEC however there are many new faction's and each faction has positive's and negative's for the PMC of your choosing.
Additional Factions WITH NPC'S that can be found, worked with, or fought:
- U.N. Peacekeeper's [NEUTRAL TO ALL FACTION'S]
[NEUTRAL WITH ALL FORCES, WILL ONLY AGGRO ON PLAYER'S AND NPC'S IF ANY TROOP GET'S SHOT OR IF 5 BULLET'S LAND CLOSE BY IN LESS THAN 5 SECONDS.
- SafeSea Naval Operative's [NEUTRAL TO BEAR AND USEC UNLESS PMC's CROSS INTO THEIR TERRITORY. NON-GOVERNMENT ENTITY.
[Contracted by both USEC and BEAR for shoreline, airspace and border control. Unknown origins, and unknown employer.
- RGF Reserve Regiment [local russian military] [HOSTILE TO USEC, NATO FORCES AND SOCOM]
[Will work with BEAR and sometimes have worked with USEC to minimize control of SafeSea via a government organization.]

_Organized Civilian Militia [Both NEUTRAL and HOSTILE to any faction that interacts with the OCM. Whether they'll be hostile or not depends on the mission parameters.]
Civilian Scavenger's [Hostile to all forces except RGF and U.N.]_
**_- British SAS [HOLSTILE TO ALL FORCES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN MISSION BRIEFING]
U.S. Special Operations Command[SOCOM] [HOLSTILE TO ALL FORCES UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN MISSION BRIEFING]
Russian Spetsnaz [HOLSTILE TO ALL FORCES except RGF UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN MISSION BRIEFING]_**
Faction's, Manufacture's, Proxy Investors - All of which cannot be found in game or as NPC's. They can only be interacted with the Custom Second Launcher/GUI.

U.N.TAR. A derivative of NATO
England
[Supplies SAS troops, and related gear]
Washington
[Supplies USEC troops, and sells related high-tech gear]
Moscow
[Supplies Spetsnaz troops and gear for RGF]
PMC UNITED
[provides NEW military equipment for special operator's with advanced training]
SURPLUSArmaments
[provides military surplus equipment from around the world. Including armour, helmets, weapons, ammo, magazines, uniforms etc]
Fence
[This is a special trader and replaces default Fence completely. After every operation, any dead troops weapons and gear will be sold for cheap even if you [the player] didn't die - some operations where the UN or Spetsnaz were hired for the mission and depending on the success or failure of your own mission decides what type of equipment will be for sale; the "grade" of your missions success [ranging from failure to A] is f-e-d-c-b-a. If you score an E that means you've failed but the overall mission was successful. F is failure.
So if the operation is titled "Operation Recover Shoreline" and you're a BEAR - you'll have access to the "CHIEF EXECUTIVE" administrative level. As BEAR is Russian their currency will be mainly RUBLE's; you'll be able to see all the money that BEAR is worth, the number of operator's, how experienced they are, their total number of kills[as well as if they were KIA].. Before starting the mission it will give you an estimate of how many enemies you can expect, as well as which faction's are present and what their view of you in the mission's location.
EXAMPLE:
Operation Recover Shoreline
As the newest VP and CTO and COO of BEAR, your first objective is to take back the Shoreline currently under the control of USEC's.
There is going to be members of USEC, SafeSea and it's possible SOCOM has established a FOB within the fortified Water Treatment Plant.
Factions known to patrol: Usec, SafeSea, U.N., SOCOM. Amongst the four known to be present factions UAV drones have estimated there to be at least 4 groups of USEC within the Treatment Plant, each group using a different armband and each group consisting of 2-5 soldier's. SafeSea PMC's have marksman protecting the westen shore from the south road up to and just before the water treatment plant's HMG Post.
U.N. Peacekeeper's are neutral to both russian and nato forces unless fired upon or upon witnessing an attack. They are there to keep the peace so whoever shoots first [and is caught] will be fighting U.N. troops as well.
Your suggested Mission Plan is the following

Hire/Utilize Moscow to send you Spetsnaz and other RGF Infantrymen.
For every operator that is not BEAR - ensure they only use basic weaponry and equipment. Give ak74m's and level 3 armour.
For every Spetsnaz Squad authorized to assist in this engagement -- ensure they're properly kitted and each group has at least one marksman or sniper; utilizing VSS' and subsonic ammo for long-range engagements may keep your engagements silent from the U.N. peacekeepers. With proper utilization of these advanced operators and weaponry you just might be capable of tricking the UN into attacking USEC [since they'll only hear the return fire from USEC and not fire from BEAR].
You currently have the following employee's:
50 BEAR Operators. 5 Spetsnaz squads, each with a marksman with a VSS.
You can request
SeaSafe to help[enlist soldiers for 1 mission is 60k rubles.]. Moscow to send Russian Military[Each troop is 12,500Rubles or 15,500 for them to come equipped with a basic loadout]. Spetsnaz for more units or squads.[Each unit is 123750rubles, a squad is 500,000rubles] Organized Civilian Militia.[each civilian hired is 15,750Rubles and they come equpped with their own weapons.]
You currently have 15M rubles, 950k USD, and 700k Euro's.
NEW [hypothetical] MENU
Bulk item purchase.
AKM X50 is 51,000 rubles
AKMN x50 is 65,000
AK74M x50 is 60,000
AK74MN x50 is 72.250
ADAR x50 2,320,033 [46k each instead of 750USD]
ETC
So at the advice of your chief of staff you first list the details:
Known activity: U.N., SeaSafe, USEC, Civilian Militia. Only USEC is hostile towards you at mission insertion. If you cross SeaSafe's zone you will be fired upon by some of the best PMC Operator's. The U.N. will only be hostile towards your group SO LONG AS YOU INITIATE THE GUNFIRE and the Peacekeeper's take notice. You can technically avoid the U.N. all together if you look at the mission's map.
With an estimated 16 USEC's, and 10 peacekeepers and 7 SeaSafe Operator's and a random number of civilian scavengers and civilian militia's.
If you establish a good relationship with the civilian militia's you'll be able to hire them on a grand scale, hiring all local civilian fighters to be hostile towards USEC. YOU choose the price to offer them. If your relationship is neutral or in the negative they may take your money and betray you, but if it's neutral or positive then there will be no chance of betrayal, a cheaper fee, and more fighters. The USEC can always counter your offer or outbid you for their work and if this takes place you won't be positive they're fighting for you. Be careful on low bid's being accepted. The higher the bid - the higher the chance that you'll establish good relations with the locals and use them to achieve your mission to liberate tarkov of foreign fighters and PMC operators.

So the following options will all be available BEFORE the mission begins AND NO YOU CANNOT CHANGE IT, OR REPEAT MISSION'S. THE MISSION'S ARE DYNAMIC AND AS YOUR FIGHTER'S GAIN MORE CONTROL YOU WILL HAVE MORE MONEY FOR BETTER EQUIPMENT. FOR EVERY SQUAD [4 MAX+YOU] YOU CAN HAND PICK THEIR LOADOUT. HERE ARE SOME OF THE DEFAULT LOADOUTS:

_PMC DEFAULT LOADOUTS_:
